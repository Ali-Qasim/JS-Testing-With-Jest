 ## Floor-Area Calculator

My grandmother asked me to help her calculate the floor area of a flat she's planning to move out of.

As is commonplace in the region, the measurements were given in feet and inches, so it wouldn't be completely straightforward to calculate in base-10 (our conventional human finger-counting system). This would be an especially tedious process when you have to calculate many rooms separately.

So, I decided to make an app for it!


This is the floor plan she gave me!

The results!
